                <h2>Types of Bacteria</h2>
                <p><b>Commensal Bacteria:</b> These Bacteria live in symbiosis with the hosts. They are present on the skin, airways and GI. Their functions are creating a barrier, producing vitamins and promote growth factor, as well they support the immune system and balance it</p>
                <p><b>Opportunistic Bacteria:</b> These bacteria do not always cause a disease but can take advantage of an existing condition</p>
                <p><b>Pathogenic Bacteria:</b> These bacteria always cause a disease.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Gram-positive vs Gram-negative</h2>
                <img src="Gram bacteria.png" alt="Gram-positive vs Gram-negative bacteria" class="image">
                <p>Looking at the structure of the <b>Gram-positive bacteria</b> on the peptidoglycan layer we find Teichoic acid, Lipoteichoic acid and surface protein, on the other hand, <b>Gram-negative bacteria</b> have on the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide(LPS) and surface protein, under the outer membrane, there is the lipoprotein layer and than the peptidoglycan layer. In conclusion, the <b>Gram-positive bacteria</b> has a thicker cell wall than <b>Gram-negative bacteria</b> </p>
                <h2> General Structure of Bacteria</h2>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Surface structures: capsule & slime layer(biofilm)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attaches on solid surfaces</li>
                    <li>Protection against phagocytic engulfment</li>
                    <li>Resistance to drying</li>
                    <li>Creates a reservoir for nutrients</li>
                    <li>Depot for waste products</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mechanisms of genetic exchange</h2>
                <img src="Horizontal Gene Transfer.png" alt="Horizontal Gene Transfer" class="image">
                <h3>Transformation</h3>
                <p>In the process of transformation, the bacteria releases naked DNA fragment through the process called cell lysis.The DNA enters the host cell and gets added to the genome</p>
                <h3>Transduction</h3>
                <p>In this process the donor cell produces bacteriophages that get releases through cell lysis. Bacteriophages than attaches to the host cell and inject their genetic information. This DNA gets integrated into their genome.</p>
                <h3>Conjugation</h3>
                <p>In this process it is the contact between cell to cell, where genetic informations exchanged through the sex pilus of the donor cell.</p>

                <p><b>Pathogenicity</b> is capacity of bacteria causing disease. <b>Virulence</b> is the degree of Pathogenicity of a microbe</p>
